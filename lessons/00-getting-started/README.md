## 🎯 What Makes This Course Different

Most Project+ materials teach business theory.

This course teaches **project management using developer logic:**

|------------------|-------------------------|
| Scope Management | Requirements control |
| Change control | Approval pipeline |
| Risk management | Future production problems |
| Issues | Current blockers |
| Stakeholders | People who can change your workload |

### 📝 Drills & Scenario Questions

Many lessons include:
- Scenario-based questions
- "What should happen "FIRST?" practice
- Common exam traps

Project+ is a **process exam**, not a memorization exam.  
These drills train you to think in the correct order.

## 🧠 How the Project+ Exam Thinks

The exam does **not** ask:
> "What is the definition of X?"

It asks:
> "Given this situation, what should the project team do next?"

To succeed, you must think about:
- Process order
- Roles and responsibilities
- Approvals and control systems
- Preventing problems before they happen

That's why this course focuses on **how projects flow**, not just terminology.

---

## ⏳ Suggested Study Order

If you are studying from scratch:
1. Project Foundations
2. Lifecycle & Deliverables
3. Roles & Communication
4. Scope & Change Control
5. Risk & Issues
6. Schedule & Resources
7. Methodologies (Agile vs Waterfall)
8. Exam Strategy

If you're reviewing or cramming, focus first on:
- Scope & Change Control
- Risk & Issues
- Roles & Communication

These appear constantly on the exam.

## ⚠️ Important Mindset Shift

In real tech jobs, we often "just fix things."

On the Project+ exam, the **correct answer is usually the controlled process answer**, not the fastest technical fix.

**Example:**  
❌ “Just implement the change”  
✅ “Submit a change request for approval”

Learning this mindset is key to passing.

## 🧩 What You Should Do Next

👉 Start with: [Lesson 01: Project Foundations](/lessons/01-project-foundations/)

This builds the mental model that makes every other lesson easier.

## 🚀 You’ve Got This

Project+ is not about being a manager.  
It's about understanding **how structured projects succeed**.

You already understand systems, dependencies, and workflows.  
This course simply maps those skills to exam language.

Let's begin!

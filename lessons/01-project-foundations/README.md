## 🎯 Lesson Goal

By the end of this lesson, you will understand:

- What **defines a project**
- The **constraints** that control every project
- How Project+ views projects differently from day-to-day operations

This lesson builds the mental framework you will use for the rest of the course.

## 🧠 Why This Matters in Real Projects

In tech, we often think of projects as "just building something." Project+ thinks differently.

A **project** is not just work — it is a **temporary system for delivering change.**

Example in a developer world:

- Building a new feature for an app
- Migrating a database
- Rewriting an authentication system
- Launching a new product

Each of these has: 
- A clear start
- A defined goal
- Limited time and resources
- A unique result

That's what makes it a *project* instead of normal operations.

## 📘 Core Concepts

### 🔹 What Is a Project?

**Definition (Exam View):**  
A **temporary endeavor** undertaken to create a **unique product, service, or result.**

**What This Means in Real Life:**  
A project has a beginning and an end. It is not ongoing support or maintenance work. It exists to create something new or change something existing.

**Not a Project:**
- Answering help desk tickets
- Routing servicer maintenance
- Daily operations work

Those are **operations**, not projects.

---

### 🔹 Project vs. Operations

<div align=center>

| Projects | Operations |
|----------|------------|
| Temporary | Ongoing |
| Unique outcome | Repetitive work |
| Creates change | Maintains stability |
| Ends when a goal is met | Never "finished" |

</div>

**Example:**
- 🚀 Deploying a brand-new application = Project
- 🛠 Keeping the application running every day = Operations

Project+ exam questions often test whether you recognize which situation you're in.

---

### 🔹 Project Constraints (The Triple Constraint)

Every project is controlled by **three major limits:**

<div align=center>

| Constraint | What It Means |
|----------|------------|
| Scope | What work is included (and not included) |
| Time | How long the project is allowed to take |
| Cost | Budget, people, and resources available |

</div>

These constraints are connected.

If one changes, the others are affected.

**Example:**

If a stakeholder adds new features (**scope increases**):
- Timeline may extend
- Budget may increase
- Resources may change

Projects are about **balancing constraints**, not just "doing more work."

---

### 🔹 Progressive Elaboration

**Definition (Exam View):**  
Project plans become more detailed as more information becomes available.

**What This Means in Real Life:**  
You don't know everything at the start. As the project progresses, requirements, risks, and plans get clearer.

Early = rough estimates

Later = detailed plans

The exam may test that early uncertainty is **normal**, not failure.

---

### 🔹 Stakeholders

**Definition (Exam View):**  
Anyone who has an interest in or is affected by the project.

**Examples:**  
- Project sponsor
- Project manager
- Developers and team members
- Customers and end users
- Executives
- Vendors

Stakeholders can influence:
- Scope
- Priorities
- Approvals

Managing stakeholder expectations is a major theme in Project+.

## ⚠️ Common Exam Traps

Project+ loves testing *misunderstandings*. Call them out clearly.

> ❌ "A project is just a large task" 
>
> ✅ A project must be **temporary** and create a **unique result.**

> ❌ "Operations work counts as a project if it's important."
>
> ✅ Importance doesn't matter — **repetition vs. uniqueness** is what matters.

> ❌ "Scope can change without affecting time or cost.
>
> ✅ Changing scope almost always impacts **time, cost, or resources.**

## 🧪 Scenario Practice

#### Scenario 1

> A team regularly updates antivirus software across all company machines every month?   
> Is this a project?

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

Correct Answer: **No**

This is ongoing, repetitive work that maintains operations. It does not produce a unique outcome or have a defined end.

</details>

#### Scenario 2

> A company is replacing its entire customer database system with a new cloud platform.   
> Is this a project or operations?

<details>
<summary>Answer & Explanation</summary>

Correct Answer: **Project**

It is temporary, has a defined goal, creates a unique result, and ends once the migration is complete.

</details>

## 🔁 How This Connects to Other Lessons

This lesson connects directly to:
- **Lifecycle & Deliverables** → How projects move through phases
- **Scope & Change Control** → How the work is controlled
- **Risk & Issues** → What threatens the projects

Understanding what a project *is* makes all later topics easier.

---

## 🧩 Key Takeaway

A project is a **temporary system for delivering change** under constraints of **scope, time, and cost.**

Project management is about **controlling those constraints**, not just completing tasks.

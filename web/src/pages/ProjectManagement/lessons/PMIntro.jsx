            <h2>Getting Started</h2>

            <p>
                This course is a structured learning system designed to help you:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Pass the CompTIA Project+ (PK0-005) certification exam</li>
                <li>Understand how structured technical projects are managed</li>
                <li>Think in process-driven terms — not just memorize definitions</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                You are not simply learning terminology. You are learning how
                controlled project environments operate in real organizations.
            </p>

            <h3>What Makes This Course Different</h3>

            <p>
                Most Project+ materials emphasize business theory.  
                This course translates project management concepts into
                <strong> developer-aligned logic</strong>.
            </p>

            <div className="table-container">
                <table className="pm-table">
                    <thead>
                        <tr>
                            <th>Traditional Term</th>
                            <th>Developer-Aligned Interpretation</th>
                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Scope Management</td>
                            <td>Requirements control</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Change Control</td>
                            <td>Approval pipeline</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Risk Management</td>
                            <td>Future production problems</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Issues</td>
                            <td>Current blockers</td>
                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>Stakeholders</td>
                            <td>Individuals who can alter workload or direction</td>
                        </tr>

            <p>
                This mental model makes scenario-based exam questions significantly
                easier to analyze.
            </p>

            <h3>How to Use This Course</h3>

            <p>
                This platform is structured sequentially. If you are new to
                Project+, follow the lessons in order.
            </p>

            <p>
                Each lesson includes:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Clear conceptual explanations</li>
                <li>Process flow emphasis</li>
                <li>Scenario-based reasoning practice</li>
                <li>Common exam traps and corrective thinking</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                If you are reviewing or preparing for retake, focus first on:
                Scope & Change Control, Risk & Issues, and Roles & Communication.
                These domains appear frequently in exam scenarios.
            </p>

            <h3>How the Project+ Exam Thinks</h3>

            <p>
                The Project+ exam does not primarily test memorization.
                It tests process reasoning.
            </p>

            <p>
                You will be presented with situational questions and asked
                what the project team should do next.
            </p>

            <p>
                Success requires understanding:
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>Correct process order</li>
                <li>Role boundaries and authority</li>
                <li>Formal approval mechanisms</li>
                <li>Preventative control before corrective action</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                In many cases, the correct answer is the controlled process
                response — not the fastest technical solution.
            </p>

            <h3>Next Step</h3>

            <p>
                Begin with <strong>Lesson 01: Project Foundations</strong>.
                This establishes the conceptual framework used throughout
                the remainder of the course.
            </p>
